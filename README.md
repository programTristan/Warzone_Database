# WARZONE DATABASE

### Project overview
* This project explores weapon damage data for 2 video games
* I create a SQL database that will hold all entires
* Following, I connect an R shiny app to the database.
* The programs used were MySQL and R Studio

### Objectives:


You can see Data source here **[HERE](https://www.downsights.com/call-of-duty-warzone-weapon-stats/#modern-warfare-2019)**:


### Data preparation
The database consists of hardcoded data entries for different weapons within the video games Call of Duty Modern Warfare & Call of Duty Black Ops 

You can see SQL query here **[HERE](https://github.com/programTristan/Warzone_Database/blob/95f5745c6a2156d51d821ebc7b78229de790ac70/SQL_Query/TristanApplebywarzone.sql)**:


### Data model:

You can see R code here **[HERE](https://github.com/programTristan/Warzone_Database/blob/95f5745c6a2156d51d821ebc7b78229de790ac70/R_Code/TristanAppleby_warzoneShiny.R)**:


### Visualizations 
The final product is a 5 plots dashboard. The first is a snapshot of sales performance while other two focus on customers and sale metrics
