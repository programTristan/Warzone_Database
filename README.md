# WARZONE DATABASE

### Project overview
* This project explores weapon damage data for 2 video games
* I create a SQL database that will hold all entires
* Following, I connect an R shiny app to the database.

### Objectives:
The goal is to build a sales report that shows summarized information about the businessÂ´s current situation to understand how to make more profits. 

The most important indicators are sales, region, top customers, and top products:


### Data preparation
The database consists of hardcoded data entries for different weapons within the video games Call of Duty Modern Warfare & Call of Duty Black Ops 

You can see Data source here **[HERE](https://www.downsights.com/call-of-duty-warzone-weapon-stats/#modern-warfare-2019)**:
